Sample SprintBoots project can be shown in different stages to introduce various aspects of the framework:
- Annotations for REST controller
- Property loading and DI with autowired
- Repositories + flyway database migration
- Repository query builder
- Exception handling


To start the sample, start with following set of files:
- go/go_debug
- pom.xml
- directory structure for src/main/java/... and resources

a)
Create SampleApplication and SampleController. Start with simple helloWorld() method to introduce annotation for RequestMapping and ResponseStatus
Create SampleConfiguration to get Swagger

b)
Create SampleProperties and application.properties to show loading and usage of properties. Use autowired annotation in SampleController to inject the
properties. Use a default string in the helloWorld from the properties.

c)
Create PersonEntity and db/migration script to create person table
Introduction to CRUD repository and flyway
Create method createPerson to show creation of user
Introduction of ResponseBody

d)
Introduction to query builder with various possibilities
Create method /person/.../hello to find a single person (first without null check)

e)
Show what happens when an unknown person is queried (NP)
Check for null and throw an exception. Show default exception handling
Add @ResponseStatus to exception

f)
Create ExceptionHandlers to group all handler methods.
Introduce ErrorResponse to group handlers
